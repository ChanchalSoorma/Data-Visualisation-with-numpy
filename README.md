# Data-Visualization-with-numpy

This repository is dedicated to creating high-quality data visualizations in Python by pairing the powerful numerical capabilities of NumPy with popular plotting libraries like Matplotlib.

## Core focus

- Fundamental visualizations: Create a wide variety of standard plots—including line plots, scatter plots, bar charts, and histograms—by feeding NumPy arrays into Matplotlib. The examples showcase how to translate raw numerical data into clear visual insights.
  
- From data to insight: The projects in the repository ([https://github.com/ChanchalSoorma/Advanced-python-using-numpy]) focus on the entire process, from loading data to preparing it with NumPy, and this repo finally generate visualizations that tell a compelling story and effectively communicate findings.
